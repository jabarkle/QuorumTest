1. System Overview & Tech Stack
Quorum is a high-performance federal procurement intelligence platform built on a serverless architecture.

Infrastructure: AWS (via SST - Serverless Stack)
Frontend: Next.js 14+ (React Server Components), hosted on AWS Lambda + CloudFront (OpenNext).
Backend: AWS Lambda (Node.js/TypeScript).
Database: Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 (PostgreSQL).
Storage: Amazon S3 (Raw solicitation documents and attachments).
Deployment: Monorepo structure managed by sst and npm.
2. Architecture & Data Flow
The system is designed for automated ingestion, processing, and retrieval of federal solicitation data.

Data Ingestion Pipeline
Scraper/Ingestion:

Source: SAM.gov API and direct scraping.
Trigger: Scheduled events or manual invocation via the ManualScraper Lambda.
Action: Raw JSON metadata and attachments are saved to the RawData S3 Bucket.
Processing (The "Meat" Extraction):

Trigger: Object creation events in S3.
Extractor: Accesses valid attachments (PDF/Docx).
Guillotine Logic: specialized regex/parsing logic ("The Guillotine") amputates legal boilerplate (Clause 2, etc.) to retain only the "meat" (SOW/PWS/Specs).
Vectorization: Processed text is chunked and embedded for semantic search.
Storage:

Structured metadata and vector embeddings are stored in Aurora Postgres (QuorumDB).
Secondary LLM Triage Integration
For your secondary LLM triage system, the key interaction points are:

Input Data: You will receive/pull extraction results which contain:

Solicitation Metadata: Title, Agency, Deadline, Set-Aside, NAICS.
Cleaned Text: The "amputated" body text (SOW/PWS) ready for LLM context windows.
Rank/Score: (Optional) Initial P(Win) or relevance score calculated by Quorum.
Output Expectations:

Your LLM should accept the cleaned_text and metadata.
Perform secondary ranking/triage.
Return a structured triage result (e.g., priority: High/Medium/Low, reasoning: "...").
3. API Access & Endpoints
All endpoints are public AWS Lambda URLs.

Key Endpoints
1. Get Opportunities (Main Feed)
GET / (on Main API)

  }
]
2. Join Waitlist
POST / (on Waitlist API)
Body: {"email": "partner@example.com"}
Response: 200 OK
4. Operational Notes
Cold Starts: Endpoints running on Lambda may have a 1-3s cold start latency.
Database Access: Direct DB access is restricted to the VPC. External tools must use the API or be whitelisted via a Bastion host.
WSL Requirement: Deployment and local development requires Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) due to OpenNext compatibility.
